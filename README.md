# Travis CI with C++17 :construction_worker:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/pauwell/test-travis.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pauwell/test-travis)

This project emerged after I had a hard time setting up `travis CI`:construction_worker: with `C++17`. 
It is a minimal example on how to get the job done!
You can take this repo as a reference or just copy `.travis.yml` and `CMakeLists.txt` and adjust them to your needs.
Please open an issue or pull request if I messed up somewhere ;)

- :fire: I tried using the least amount of code to get a working example.
- :fire: Please take a look at this [pull request](https://github.com/pauwell/travis-ci-with-cplusplus-17/pull/2) to see `travis CI` dynamically testing new requests. 
- :fire: This [pull request](https://github.com/pauwell/travis-ci-with-cplusplus-17/pull/3) shows how `travis CI` fails if there is an error in the code.
